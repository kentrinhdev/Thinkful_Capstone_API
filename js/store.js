    question: "Which hero is also known as Big Red?",
    choices: ["Batman", "Hellboy", "Deadpool", "Red Tornado"],
    answer: "Hellboy",
    feedback: "Hellboy is a fictional superhero created by writer-artist Mikeâ€…Mignola. He said that Hellboy's personality is loosely based off his father being a Korean War guy, a tough guy, one of those guys who would come home with blood all over himself from getting his hand stuck in a piece of machinery. He was so leathery. You knew he could strike one of those old fashioned matches off of his calloused hands. As far as the stories go, Mignola's fascination with ghosts and monsters began at an early age, reading Dracula at age 12 introduced him to Victorian literature and folklore, from which he has never recovered. This clearly had a heavy influence on the creation of Hellboy. In August 1993, Mignola debuted the first appearance of Hellboy in San Diego Comic-Con #2 published by Dark Horse Comics.",

    question: "What movie released in 2004 with same title as hero is also known as Big Red?",
    choices: ["Deadpool", "Hellboy", "The Amazing Spider-Man", "Hellboy II: The Golden Army"],
    answer: "Hellboy",
    feedback: "Hellboy is a 2004 American superhero movie directed by Guillermo del Toro starring Ron Perlman, loosely based on the Dark Horse Comics graphic novel Hellboy: Seed of Destruction by Mike Mignola. Del Toro for years considered this film a dream project, and had always wanted to cast Ron Perlman in the lead, but could never secure a budget or studio approval. After the massive success of Blade II (2002), del Toro was offered Blade: Trinity (2004) or Hellboy, and though he briefly considered trying to schedule both in, he chose Hellboy. In the film, a demonic beast-turned superhero known as Hellboy, secretly works to keep the world safe from paranormal threats with his team, the Bureau of Paranormal Research and Defense. In the comics, the B.P.R.D. was founded in late 1944 by Professor Trevor Bruttenholm to combat various occult threats uncovered in operations against Nazi Germany. It initially had strong links to the United States Army Air Forces and was based at a military airbase in New York. By 1948, the Bureau relocated to a custom built facility in Fairfield, Connecticut then for the flim eventually ended up in an abandoned research facility in Colorado New Jersey.",

    question: "Which hero is also known as Wall Crawler?",
    choices: ["Superman", "Venom", "Batman", "Spider-Man"],
    answer: "Spider-Man",
    feedback: "Spider-Man is a fictional superhero created by writer-editor Stan Lee and writer-artist Steve Ditko. He first appeared in the anthology comic book Amazing Fantasy #15 in the Silver Age of Comic Books released in August 1962 published by Marvel Comics. When Kirby showed Stan Lee the first six pages he had drawn, Lee recalled that he hated the way Kirby was doing it! Not that he did it badly--it just wasn't the character that Lee wanted. It was too heroic. Instead, Lee turned to Steve Ditko, who developed a visual style Lee found satisfactory. In the comics, Spider-Man is the alias of Peter Parker an orphan raised by his Aunt May and Uncle Ben in New York City after his parents Richard and Mary Parker were killed in a plane crash. Lee and Ditko had the character deal with the struggles of adolescence and financial issues, and accompanied him with many supporting characters, such as J. Jonah Jameson, Flash Thompson, Harry Osborn, romantic interests Gwen Stacy and Mary Jane Watson, and foes such as Doctor Octopus, Green Goblin and Venom. His origin story has him acquiring spider-related abilities after a bite from a radioactive spider which include clinging to surfaces, shooting spider-webs from wrist-mounted devices, and detecting danger with his Spider-Sense.",
